    ">Did you record the experimental design?\n",
    "\n",
    "The well log data is acquired by the logging tool during or after drilling the well. Different tools provide different measurements which behave differently depending on the nature of the rock being drilled. Analysis of the well logs together gives us the information about what kind of a rock we would be drilling. Machine Learning approach can automate the process of identification of rock.\n",
